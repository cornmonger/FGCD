============

*The FGCD project source-code is licensed under the GNU Public License (GPL, version 3). The project is owned, operated, and maintained by Else.club, a division of Asmov LLC. Asmov is a limited liability company registered in the state of California, USA.*

All community contributions to this project must be made under a **Copyright Assignment Agreement** (CAA) between the contributor and Asmov LLC. The agreement effectively transfers ownership of the contribution to Asmov.

Copyright transfers allow us to dual-license the project and its components where necessary. This is especially useful for distribution channels such as the Apple App Store, which is not compatible with the GPL.

The CAA is based off of the Harmony agreement template created by Canonical (Ubuntu). There are two copies which must be filled out and signed: "Formal" and "GPG". The "Formal" form will be kept privately by Asmov. The "GPG" form will be public and published to the project repository.

## Requirements
- The email address you provide in the agreement form must match everywhere else:
  - Used to push commits
  - Used to sign commits
  - Used to email us the signed agreement document
- Your real name is required in the "Formal" form.

## Instructions
1. Read the agreement. Ask a lawyer for legal advice if there are any questions.
2. Fill out the "Formal" agreement, sign it, and convert it directly to PDF.
3. Fill out the "GPG" agreement. Convert it directly to PDF. GPG sign the PDF file.
4. Email us the "Formal" and "GPG" PDF files along with the ".asc" GPG signature file.
